I'm looking for an opportunity to obtain a lot of new technical abilities such as code writing and problem-solving skills.

I wish to do my best to realize my real capabilities and become a high-level professional in the IT industry.

This project allows me to do the first step in Web-development and get to know web basics.

I learn a new big and very interesting world known as Web-development.
